          <h2>4. Kewve’s role </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Kewve facilitates the supply of goods through the Kewve Marketplace but does not buy or sell them on its
              own behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kewve acts as agent for purchasers of the goods and has authority on behalf of purchasers to conclude
              contracts with suppliers as agent for the purchaser. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Kewve is not a party to these contracts and has no liability to either the purchaser or to the supplier
              under them.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>5. How the Kewve Marketplace works</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Kewve receives purchasers’ requirements for goods and will make these requirements available on the Kewve
              Marketplace to suppliers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each purchaser will state its requirement for goods including, as appropriate, their quantity, quality,
              specification, and any applicable standard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Offers to supply goods will be invited from suppliers and Kewve will notify the purchaser of offers
              received.
            </li>
            <li>
              The essential commercial terms of each offer will be set out in the Kewve Marketplace, including the
              description of the goods, their quantity, details of delivery, the price and payment terms.  Purchaser
              acknowledges that the goods offered may not meet its requirements and that it is the purchaser’s
              responsibility to review the offer and check that it meets purchaser’s requirements before the offer is
              accepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The price of goods shown shall, unless otherwise specified, be inclusive of any applicable Value Added Tax
              (VAT) 
            </li>
            <li>
              The purchaser acknowledges that:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The information that Kewve receives concerning the rate and amount of VAT applicable to the
                  transaction is provided to Kewve by the supplier. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kewve does not check the accuracy of the information provided at clause 5.5 and Kewve does not warrant
                  by relaying this information to the purchaser that the information is correct.
                </li>
                <li>Kewve does not obtain information from the supplier regarding applicable duties. </li>
                <li>
                  Kewve is not responsible for determining whether (and if so at what rate) VAT or duties apply to the
                  sale and accounting for and paying VAT and duties is the responsibility of the purchaser and supplier
                  (as the case may be) according to the contract between them and the relevant laws in force governing
                  the sale.    
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Kewve will use its reasonable endeavours to make available to each purchaser a summary of the supplier’s
              terms and conditions of business. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Any contract between the purchaser and the supplier shall incorporate the commercial terms set out in the
              Kewve Marketplace (such as description of the goods, price, payment and shipping terms) and the supplier’s
              terms and conditions of business, which it is the purchaser’s responsibility to review.
            </li>
            <li>
              If an offer is approved by the purchaser, Kewve will inform the supplier of the purchaser’s identity and
              conclude a contract for those goods between the purchaser and the supplier. Payment for the goods,
              together with any additional fees, commissions and taxes, shall be made through third party services
              embedded in or accessed through the Kewve Marketplace. Duties shall be payable separately to the
              applicable authorities by the buyer or supplier in accordance with their contract. 5.10 Kewve does not
              promise to proceed with any transaction and may withdraw or change any requirement before any contract is
              concluded between the purchaser and supplier.
            </li>
            <li>
              The supplier may withdraw an offer by giving notice to Kewve, provided notice is received by Kewve before
              the contract is concluded. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Suppliers are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of any information posted on the Kewve
              Marketplace, including any offers prepared on supplier’s behalf by Kewve, and supplier undertakes to check
              regularly that the information is current and to keep it up to date.
            </li>
            <li>
              Suppliers are responsible for accurately describing products to be sold on the Kewve Marketplace and
              ensuring that products described in their offer are available for sale at the time any contract with a
              purchaser is concluded.
            </li>
            <li>Products supplied shall conform to their description and shall be fit for their intended purpose.</li>
            <li>
              Kewve shall have no liability to either the supplier or the purchaser for any breach of contract for the
              sale of goods, nor have any interest in or responsibility for any dispute relating to that contract.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kewve will charge the purchaser a commission on each sale to the purchaser made through the Kewve
              Marketplace or where the introduction was made through Kewve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Kewve will charge the supplier a fee for the use of the Kewve Marketplace on each sale to the purchaser
              made through the Kewve Marketplace or where the introduction was made through Kewve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Supplier and purchaser hereby irrevocably authorise Kewve to deduct their commission and the fee for using
              the Kewve Marketplace at the time of payment for the goods, or in the case of subscription fees, at the
              point of subscription. 
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>6. Indemnity. </h2>
          <p>
            The purchaser and the supplier shall indemnify Kewve against any liability incurred by Kewve in properly
            discharging its obligations under these terms and conditions, except to the extent that the liability arises
            as a result of the negligence of or breach of these terms and conditions by Kewve.
